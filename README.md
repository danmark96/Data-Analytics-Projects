# Data-Analytics-Projects
This is a collection of the data analytics projects I have completed to accompany my CV.
The first is a project I have completed on the determinants of London house prices using Land Registry, ONS and Google maps data. For this both a jupyter notebook showing all the code used and a pdf containing a full report have been included.
There are aso two dashboards consisting of dummy data for bank customers in Power BI and Tableau from two Udemy courses I have completed.
